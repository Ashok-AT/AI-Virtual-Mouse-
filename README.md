# AI Virtual Mouse

A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a system without using an actual mouse. It can also be considered hardware because it uses an ordinary web camera. A virtual mouse can be operated with multiple input devices, including an actual mouse or a computer keyboard. This virtual mouse works with the help of different image processing techniques.
